            <h3>History of Notary </h3>
            <p>Here is a quote from NNA's Website:</p>
            <blockquote
                cite="https://www.nationalnotary.org/knowledge-center/about-notaries/notary-history?srsltid=AfmBOootNX8AQrDuJcLefXQ6fkGQx9lLBfXIOoMFXxDovxydHwSStlgN">
                Ancient Egypt: 2750-2250 B.C.

                Ancient Egyptian "sesh," or "scribes," were established in the Old Kingdom and were the earliest known
                chroniclers of official communications in recorded history. Scribes made up an entire level of the
                ancient Egyptian bureaucracy. Personal letters, official proclamations, tax records, and other documents
                all went through their hands. The recording of events was so highly valued that Pharaoh Tutankhamen even
                included writing equipment in his tomb for the afterlife.
